      <h2 class="mb-0"> Lattice QCD </h2>
        <p> 
          My main research interest is to understand the interactions of the strong force,
          one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction">
          four fundamental forces</a>, using numerical methods.  The strong interaction is responsible
          for holding together subatomic particles called <b>hadrons</b>, the two most famous being 
          protons and neutrons.  Studying these small particles requires the merging of quantum mechanics
          and relativity, which required the development of quantum field theory starting in the 1920's.  
          The quantum field theory that describes the strong interaction is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD),
          for which there is no analytic solution.
        </p>
      <p>
          Lattice QCD(LQCD) is the only first-principles approach to understanding the fundamentals of QCD and thus
          to the structure and interactions of hadrons.  This approach approximates the real world, which is infinite in 
          volume and continous in space and time, replacing it with a discrete lattice containing a finite number of points.  
          The "matter" particles are placed on the sites
          of this lattice and the "force carrying" particles live in-between the sites.  Calculations are performed on
          supercomputers via Monte Carlo importance sampling.  Within LQCD I specifically work on multiparticle scattering 
          projects.  These are important because when two subatomic particles scatter with each other, they can resonate into 
          a single particle (depending on the physical setup).  This happens not only in LQCD but also in experiment, giving 
          us the chance to really test our understanding of the standard model and learn more about it. 
      </p>
      <h4 class="mb-4"> Three-particle scattering </h4>
      <p> There are two forefronts in LQCD scattering research, one is the study of baryon-baryon scattering, the other 
        is to push to understand three or more particle scattering.  
        My research group was the first to publish results for a three-particle resonance, 
        the a<sub>1</sub>(1260), in which we used LQCD data to estimate the physical resonance parameters 
        using the correct description of three-particle interactions.

        <h2 class="mb-0"> Quantum Computing for Supersymmetry </h2>
      <p> 
        Quantum computing is an approach to computing by performing computations on quantum states instead of classical
        ones.  One of the key things to understand is the classical bits can only be in the state 0 or 1, while quantum
        bits, <b>qubits</b> can be in both states, which is known as superposition.  In some classes of numerical application
        quantum algorithms provide an exponential speedup over their classical counterparts.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Supersymmetric theories are a proposed extension to the standard set of symmetries used in quantum field theories (rotations and boosts).
        The additional symmetry is a symmetry transformation that replaces bosons (integer spin particles) with fermions (half integer spin).
        While we do not have any experimental evidence to suggest supersymmetry is a correct description of the universe, it has 
        nice features important for us to understand.  These two features are symmetry breaking (since supersymmetry <i>must</i> be broken).
        Another feature is that it is known that supersymmetric theories are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">
          holographically dual</a> to quantum gravitational theories.  Holographic duality allows us to learn about quantum gravitational 
          systems be instead studying the <i>dual</i> quantum field theory.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For any quantum field theory, quantum computing is an approach that lets us completely avoid the Monte-Carlo approach of LQCD.
        Within a quantum computing formalism we can directly work with states of the quantum field theory.  We can directly perform 
        operations of states of interest, and measure properties of the state, like its energy.  For a supersymmetric field theory it
        is straightforward to tell if the supersymmetry is broken or preserved by measuring the ground state energy.  The supersymmetry 
        is preserved if and only if the ground state energy of the system is zero.  For this we are using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver">
        variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)</a>.  
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4> Machine Learning </h4>
      <p>
        Apart from using the VQE to compute the ground state energy, I am also interested in a machine learning approach based on 
        the variational method.  Instead of using qubit states to compute the ground state energy we use a neural network as 
        our quantum wavefunction.  By telling a learning algorithm to minimize the energy as a loss function, the neural network 
        will learn the ground state wavefunction.  Once the ground state is learned it is straightforward task to compute the energy.
